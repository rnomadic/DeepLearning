### Background
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. 

### Objective
The object of this project is to predict how many bikes I need in future. Because in a day if there is less number of bikes than the passenger, then I am wasting people's time. At the same time if I parked too many bike then I am wasting the resource.

### Instruction
1. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the platform.
2. Create a new conda environment: conda create --name nn python=3
3. source activate nn
4. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
