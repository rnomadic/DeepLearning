### Character Sequence to Sequence
In this notebook, we'll build a model that takes in a sequence of letters, 
and outputs a sorted version of that sequence. We'll do that using what we've 
learned so far about Sequence to Sequence models. This notebook was updated to 
work with TensorFlow 1.1 and builds on the work of Dave Currie. Check out Dave's 
post Text Summarization with Amazon Reviews.
